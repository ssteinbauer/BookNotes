Groups do not always arrive at better decisions than individuals

Groups can amplify individual errors

Group errors can be mitigated by both formal and informal methods
* Break problem solving into exploratory and critical thinking phases
* Experts should share information (information asymmetry harms group decision making)
* Explicit cost-benefit analysis
* Role Assignment (real devil's advocate, red teaming)
* Leverage anxious people: what can wrong (keep asking this question)

Characteristics of Groups
* can amplify errors
* hard
* get more extreme
* emphasize shared vs unshared information

Ways to counter-act
* self silencing leaders
* role assignment
* explore then select 
* statistical groups
* experts
* tournaments
* prediction markets
* Factor-c (social sensitivity)
