## 1. Reading Programs
We must understand chine, language and programmer limitations (7-11)

### Historical Traces
It is important to make an effort to acknowledge the historical reality of a program developed over a period of time; new language features, idiosycratic bug fixes, odd fixes/code to address released bugs or earlier bad decisions (11)

A formulation of _Conways Law_ (1967):

> ...the very structure of the program may be determeind by the size and composition of the programming group that originally wrote it... (12)

### Specifications
>"...we might begin to believe that very little of the coding that is done in the world has much to do with the problems we are trying to solve....Yet even if we succeed in extracting this kernal of the program, we must not be misled into the illusion that we could have started with this kernal as a specification and had some system take care of the other limitations....in most cases, we do not know what we want to do until we have taken a flying leap at programming it." (12)

>"Specifications evolve toegether with programs and programmers." (12)

### Comments on Chapter 1: Reading Programs
>"superior developers tend to find value with walktrhough and inspection processes while the merely clever do not." (1.i)
