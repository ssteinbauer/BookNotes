## 3. How can we Study Programming

### Introspection
Introspection can lead to deeper understanding to facilitate a more analytical exploration of a problem space (29)

### Observation (30)
"Hawthorne Effect": the effect of observation can produce the phenomenon being observed (31)

It can be valuable to be "invisible"

1. anthropologically invisible - become one with the group being observed
1. observe in such a way that the observed do not know they are being observed

### Experiment (32)
Studying programmers is subject to difficultying in measurement (34), construction biases, hard to repeat (35), can be expensive

### Psychological Measurement (36)
Maxwell, "To measure is to Know" -> perhaps more valuably interpreted as "To know what to measure is to know"

> "And since we are working so much in the dark, we most certainly cannot afford to pass up the 'folk wisdom' [of] our subjects, even if they ultimately prove groundless, or even outright wrong" (37)

We are still primarily "looking for questions"

### Using Behavioral Science Data (38)
will look to 

1. programming "culture"
1. programming as an individual activity
1. tooling 
1. integrating into the "culture"
1. examine some myths

### Summary
Common Pitfalls (40)

1. Using introspection without validation
1. Using of observations on an overly narrow base
1. Observing the wrong variables, or failing to observe the right ones
1. Interfering with the observed phenomenon
1. Generating too much data and not enough information
1. Overly constraining experiments
1. Depending excessively on trainees as subjects
1. Failing to study group effects and group behavior
1. Measuring what is simple to measure
1. Using unjustified precision
1. Transferring borrowed results to inapplicable situations

### Questions for Programmers

1. Do you ever sit back and trace the paths that led to bug
1. Do you keep records on your performance (41)

## Comments on Chapter 3: How can we Study Programming
> "Over the years, I've observed that the best programmers are the most introspective. If they do something wrong, they examine the mental proceses (or physical processes) that led to the problem; then they do something to change the process" (3.i)
* Weinberg and Wienberg -> root-cause analsis

"Managers who pay attendtion to people get good results (3.ii)

Hawthorne Effect can be used to positive effect

> "The devastating cost of individual variation on real projects has supported the validity of my prediction that the individual working alone is neither a fruitful unit of study, **nor a prodcutive component of programming project work**" (3.iii)

most measurement seems to be directed at controlling programmers not understanding programming/programmers

The years have validated that programmers do have a culture
