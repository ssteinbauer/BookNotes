## 2. What Makes a Good Program
What does it mean to measure the quality of programs ?(15-16)

absolute measurement is probably not possible but perhaps we can create a relative scale taking into account "a situation---a total situation--in which they are developed." (16-17)

### Specifications
utmost requirement is that programs are correct (17)

>'Aha,' was the triumphan reply. 'But _my_ program takes only one second per card.'

### Schedule
"a program that is late is often worthless" (19)

Most people prefer consistency and accuracy in estimates vs extremely variale and inaccurate estimates (20)

### Adaptibility
Build your programs to the level worthy of the likely lifetime of the solution (20)

Why do we so often write programs that are hard to modify when we know the the program will most likely be modified "adaptibility is not free" (20-21)

_Fisher's Fundamental Theorem_ (R.A Fisher) states that the better adapted a systme is to a particular environment, the less adaptable it is to a new environment (21)

Make sure to validate that specialization/optimization is really appropriate for the problem you are solving (22)

Efficiency and adaptability are often not easy to achieve simoultaneously

Questions for Managers (25)

1. "On what bases do you reward programmers? Are certain of your crieria mutually contradicotry?"
2. Are your programs adaptable, if not, why not, can you trace to incentives (26)
3. How important is the schedule and do you see how schedule above quality might impact programmer decision making

Questions for Programmers

1. "Do you have criteria explicitly in mind whe you start on a project?"  Where do the criteria come from?
2. Do you think about people reading your software in the future?

### Comments on Chapter 2: What Makes a Good Program?

The programmer that makes software that sells (or is used) is the better programmer (2.i)

"Quality is value to some person."
