The most primitive guerrillas were the most successful (52)

"...ancient insurgents were generally on their own to face the pitiless power of the pagan polity"
 * appealing to the population of a king, emperor, or chief was challenging/impossible and would probably have little effect in an autocracy

The nomadic conquerors inflicted serious and lasting damage on established states (Arabs, Turks, Mongols, Moguls, Goths) through incessant pressure and highly effective hit-and-run tactics (52-3)

Nomadic warfare was no match for the emergence of highly organized states using gunpowder and by the 18th and 19th centuries was only visible on the periphery emerging empires

The emergence of printed books allowed insurgency tactics to become more widely available around the world (54), the presages the importance of propaganda in more modern insurgencies (55)

Counterinsurgents were able to learn much earlier (54):
 * Strategikon (~600 AD), Byzantine Emperor Maurice
 * How to Survive Under Siege, Aeneas Tacitus (4th C. BC)
 * Histories, Herodotus
* Gallic Wars, Caesar
