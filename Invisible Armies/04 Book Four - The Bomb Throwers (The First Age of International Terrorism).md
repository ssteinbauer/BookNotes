"Terrorism, as defined here, must be carried out by substate groups. Moreover, while all of the guerilla groups described so far killed some civilians...that was not their primary emphasis." (205)

Prior to the nineteenth century there were very few terrorists groups. There were however assassins.

Early assassins tended to target the "great and powerful" (Caesar) (207-8)

"terrorism is strikingly modern. It has been made possible by the spread of four phenomena: destructive and portable weaponry, the mass media, literacy, and secular ideologies". (209)

Terrorism generally doesn't work but some groups have been successful (KKK blocked Reconstruction, IRA and Irish independence, Russian Revolutionaries, German and Japanese militants during the interwar period) (210)

Pretty much the only thing terrorists have had in common is that they are young (261)

"Alan Krueger...concludes that 'terrorists tend to be drown form well-educated, middle-class or high-income families.' So if poverty does not cause terrorism, what does?"
  * suppression of civil liberties and political rights (264)

For others it may perhaps be to "commit acts of violence" (Jerrold Post) and an attempt to gain notoriety

But clearly there is no single psychopathy
