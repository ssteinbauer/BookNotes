## Twelve Articles, or The Lessons of Five Thousand Years

1. "Guerrilla warfare has been ubiquitous and important throughout history"  (557)

    The shape of the modern world emerged from guerrilla warfare (middle East, southeast Asia, the Baltic, the United States, swaths of Africa, etc.) and guerrilla warfare was the defacto style of war for most of the world for most of history prior to the Industrial Revolution

1. "Guerrilla warfare is not an 'Eastern Way of War'; it is the universal war of the weak" (558)

    "[for tribes] irregular warffare was a way of life." States adopt regular armies guerrilla warfare is not the preferred organization, but it allows the weak to attack the strong. Terrorism is a tactic adopted by "those too weak to create guerilla forces."

1. "Guerrilla warfare has been both underestimated and overestimated"

    A string of high-profile guerrilla victories (China, Vietnam, Cuba) since 1945 has "invested [the modern guerrilla] with the nimbus of invincibility" but history tells a more varied story. From 1775-1945 about 25% of insurgencies were successful, since 1945, the number is 50.8%, including ongoing conflicts. If those conflicts are counted as losses the win rate declines to 21.9% (559)

1. "Insurgencies have been getting more successful since 1945 but still lose most of the time." (559)

    See "Guerrilla warfare has been both underestimated and overestimated"

1. "The most important development in guerrilla warfare in the last two 
hundred years has been the rise of public opinion"

    Modern democracies must maintain the support of citizens to engage in protracted counterinsurgencies. Public opinion (i.e., modern news media and the internet) make it increasingly easy to win hearts with propaganda (US vs Britain, Vietnam, Iraq pre-surge). For less free-states this is less of an issue (Russia and Afghanistan's scorched earth policy, Chechnya, Georgia)

1. "Conventional tactics don't work against an unconventional threat." (561)

1. "Few counterinsurgents have ever succeeded by inflicting mass terror--at least in foreign lands"

    "The brute-force approach is most successful when the rebel movement is very weak, or better still, nonexistent and the counterinsurgents are trying to pacify their own territory, where they have at least some degree of legitimacy, considerable knowledge of the human and geographic terrain, and can bring overwhelming force to bear." (Stalin's Great Terror, Mao's Cultural Revolution)

    "Stathis Kalyvas...has concluded that 'indiscriminate violence seems to be counter-productive, with the exception of situations where this is a high imbalance of power.'" (562)

1. "Population-centric counterinsurgency is often successful, but it's not a touchy-feely as commonly supposed" (562)

    "winning the hearts and minds", first used by General Henry Clinton during American Revolution, "popularized by General Templer in the 1950s"

    Without security this policy does not result in success, if supporting the counterinsurgency/government is risky (i.e., deadly) there won't be enough support for hearts and minds to matter. Security requires force (violence) and vigilance

    "Security may be ten percent of the problem, or it may be ninety percent, but whichever it is, it's the first ten percent or the first ninety percent." Without security, nothing else we do will last" John Paul Vann (563)

1. "Establishing legitimacy is vital for any successful insurgency or counterinsurgency--and, in modern times, that is hard to achieve for a foreign group or government" (563)

    Foreign-powers, in modern times, will likely have to "buttress the legitimacy of homegrown regimes rather than simply impose their own colonial officials at bayonet point"

    Insurgents must also establish legitimacy (Jihadism, Marxism-Leninism in China). The most enduring ideology has been Nationalism (not anarchism, socialism, Islamism) (564)

1. "Most insurgencies are long-lasting; attempts to win a quick victory backfire" (564)

    The average length of insurgencies since 1775 is 10 years, since 1945 it goes up to 14 years. However, there is no correlation between the length of the insurgency and the likelihood of success.

    When facing an foreign counterinsurgency, duration may favor the insurgent but when facing domestic resistance, that is not the case.

    Eliminating the oppositionâ€™s leadership also does not appear to increase chances of success, especially for established insurgencies. Premature major offensives on the part of the insurgent group can be a source of significant weakening for the insurgent group.

1. "Guerrillas are most effective when able to operate with outside support--especially with conventional army units" (566)

    United States and France
    Arabs and English/French
    Korea and China

1. "Technology has been less important in guerrilla war than in conventional war--but that my be changing" (567)

    Insurgents, tend to be (almost by definition) militarily-technologically inferior. Technology that allows engagement with a broader audience has had the most significant impact on the success of insurgencies (e.g., the printing press or the internet).
