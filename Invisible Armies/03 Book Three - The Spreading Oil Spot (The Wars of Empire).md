The emergence of the "liberal" west was paired with the expansion of western Empires over much of the non-European world (127)

This is the period when the shape of the modern world starts to take shape

"The Spreading Oil Spot Doctrine" (precursor to the "population-centric" model)

    "...slowly pushing out army posts and settlements until the indigenous resistance was crushed." 

Europeans won most of the battles and wars during this period (American colonialism, India, Africa, south east Asia); notable exceptions being Britain in Afghanistan (1842) and the Battle of Little Bighorn (1876), but losses were only temporary setbacks (127-128)

The west was exceptionally more powerful but most opponents met the European armies in traditional conflicts where they were at a significant disadvantage. One explanation for this is that many opponents had no idea how severely they were outgunned (129).

Another reason is that existing power structures were not likely to want to become insurgents, they were more likely to want to emulate the powerful European states (130).

Over the period of imperial expansion, guerrillas started to close the gap, primarily by winning the war of minds using propaganda and the press (200) but also through increased attrition of the outside forces (199)

Established institutions start to pay more attention to guerrilla warfare:

* _Small Wars: Their Principles and Practice_ Marine Corps'
* _Small Wars Manual_, Colonel Charles Edward Callwell
    
    "guerilla warfare is a form of operations above all things to be avoided. The whole spirit of the art of conducting small wars is to strive for the attainment of decisvive methods, the very essence of partison warfare from the point of the enemy being to avoid definite engagement."

    "The enemy must be chastised up to a certain point but not driven to desperation"

    "wholeseale destruction of property of the enemy may sometimes do more harm than good"

"This was about as far as Callwell got in acknowledging the political aspect of counterinsurgency, which his British successors would view as paramount"

The end of this period also marks the beginning of the end imperialism. The spread of democracy and modern weapons begins to level the intellectual and military playing field (200-1)
